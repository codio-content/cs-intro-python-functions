## Lab 2 - Sorting the Movie Data

You saw how to sort a list with the `sort` method. But sorting the movie data is a bit tricky because it is a list of lists. 

![List of Lists](.guides/images/list-of-lists.png)

Using the `sort` method on the outer list will arrange the movies in alphabetical order. We want the application to be able to sort the movie data in a variety of ways.

![Sort Outer List](.guides/images/movie-sort-outer-list.png)

What if, for example, the user wants to sort the data by date of release? Using the sort method on each inner list rearranges the order of the movie info. That means the function you just wrote to print the movie info will not work as intended. There also exists a case in which the star rating will come before the date. A movie with a rating of `"1 Star"` will come after the release date if it is `"2007"`.

Thankfully Python has a way to sort `movie_data` by elements of the inner lists without messing up the output of the program. Import the `operator` module along with `csv`. Next, define the function `sort_movie_data` with the parameters `data` and `index`. Make the function body `pass`.

```python
import csv, operator

movie_csv = "student_folder/.labs/movie_data.csv"

def fetch_movie_data(movie_csv):
    """Return movie data from a CSV file"""
    with open(movie_csv, "r") as movie_file:
        reader = csv.reader(movie_file)
        movie_info = []
        for row in reader:
          movie_info.append(row)
        return movie_info

def print_movie_data(data):
    """Print the movie data in easy to read columns"""
    for title, genre, rotten, gross, year in data:
      print("{:36} {:10} {:18} {:16} {}".format(title, genre, rotten, gross, year))
      
def sort_movie_data(data, index):
    """Sort movie data based on the column data"""
    pass
      
movie_data = fetch_movie_data(movie_csv) 
print_movie_data(movie_data)
```

The `index` parameter lets Python know which element to use for sorting the order of the inner lists. Sorting all of `movie_data` will take the headers from the CSV file and mix them up with the movies themselves. Instead create a list called `header` and set its value to `data[0]`. Then make another list called `sorted_movies` and set its value to `data[1:]`. The first row of `movie_data` (the column titles) is stored in `header`. And the rest of `movie_data` is stored in `sorted_movies`. Except the movie information has not yet been sorted. You are going to use the `sort` method on `sorted_movies`, but put the following code in between the parentheses `key=operator.itemgetter(index)`. To use `operator`, you need to import it. Then return data. Finally, change the function call for `print_movie_data` to `print_movie_data(sort_movie_data(movie_data, 0))`.

```python
import csv, operator

movie_csv = "student_folder/.labs/movie_data.csv"

def fetch_movie_data(movie_csv):
    """Return movie data from a CSV file"""
    with open(movie_csv, "r") as movie_file:
        reader = csv.reader(movie_file)
        movie_info = []
        for row in reader:
          movie_info.append(row)
        return movie_info

def print_movie_data(data):
    """Print the movie data in easy to read columns"""
    for title, genre, rotten, gross, year in data:
      print("{:36} {:10} {:18} {:16} {}".format(title, genre, rotten, gross, year))
      
def sort_movie_data(data, index):
    """Sort movie data based on the column data"""
    header = data[0]
    sorted_movies = data[1:]
    sorted_movies.sort(key=operator.itemgetter(index))
    sorted_movies.insert(0, header)
    return sorted_movies
      
movie_data = fetch_movie_data(movie_csv) 
print_movie_data(sort_movie_data(movie_data, 0))
```

{try it}(python3 code/functions/movie-app.py 5)

Sorting like this, however, not work with when the `index` is 3. That is because that column is read as a string, not number. That means sorting this column will puth `$110` before `$20`. When `index` is 3, then the sorting should use floats instead of strings. To do this, first create the function `get_money` which takes `gross` as its parameter. This function returns element 3 which has been typecast as a float.

```python
def get_money(gross):
  return float(gross[3])
```

Next, modify `sort_movie_data` with a conditional that tests for when `index` is 3. If true, sort the movies with `key` set to the function `get_money`. If `index` is not 3, then use the sort code from the example above.

```python
def sort_movie_data(data, index):
    """Sort movie data based on the column data"""
    header = data[0]
    sorted_movies = data[1:]
    if index == 3:
      sorted_movies.sort(key=get_money)
    else:
      sorted_movies.sort(key=operator.itemgetter(index))
    sorted_movies.insert(0, header)
    return sorted_movies
```
