## Helper Functions

Well written functions are those with a single, specific task. Complex problems will require more than one function for the solution. Helper functions are functions that are called from within other functions. Take, for example, the formula for calculating the area of a circle:
$$A = \pi r^2$$

It would be quite easy to write a Python function to calculate the area of a circle. However, instead of knowing the radius of the circle, you have the X/Y coordinates for a point at the center of the circle and another point on the circle. The distance formula (which is based on the Pythagorean Theorem) can calculate the radius of the circle.
$$\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}$$

The area function is dependent upon the distance formula. This is where helper functions come into play. Start by defining a function `radius`. The square root function is included in the `math` module. Be sure to import `math` in your program. Then define a function `area` which calls `radius`. Since `area` requires `radius`, `area` also requires all of the parameters needed for the `radius` function. Finally, print the result of the area of a circle with the points (0, 0) and (4, 4).

```python
import math

def radius(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """Distance formula to determine the radius of a circle"""
    return(math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2))
  
def area(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """Area of a circle function"""
    return(math.pi * radius(x1, y1, x2, y2)**2)

print(area(0, 0, 4, 4))
```

## Use `math.pow` instead of `**2`
Since the `math` module is being used, replace the `**2` with `math.pow` in the distance formula above. To square the number 3, you would write `math.pow(3, 2)`.

## Inner Functions

Python allows you to declare a function inside another function. Doing this hides the inner function from the main program. In the code below, only the `area` function can call the `radius` function. 

```python
import math
  
def area(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """Area of a circle function"""
    def radius(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        """Distance formula to determine the radius of a circle"""
        return(math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2))
    
    return(math.pi * radius(x1, y1, x2, y2)**2)
  
print(area(0, 0, 4, 4))
```

## Inner Function
Make `calc_pi` an inner function of `area` as well.
